## 😀 Hi there!
I'm a passionate Data Analyst who recently transitioned from architecture to the exciting world of Data! 🚀 
<p>Yes! I'm now more interested in the structure of a database than the structure of a building. </p>
My journey into the data world started with a love for problem-solving and analytical thinking and a desire to build innovative solutions.

## 🌟 About me 
#### 🔄 Career Switcher
  After several years in architecture, I decided to take a leap and dive into the exciting world of Data Analysis and Data Science. It's been an incredible journey of learning and growth, and I'm thrilled to share my projects with you. I'm particularly interested in Data Visualization and Data Science (I want to be a Data Scientist one day), and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks.
#### 🌱 New Beginning
  After learning through online course of OpenClassRooms for serveral months, I'm currently enrolled in the online 'Chef de Projet IA' course offered by Wild Code School.

### I'm still new in Github, feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me. 🌍✨
