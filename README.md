## 😀 Hi there!
I'm a passionate Data Analyst who recently transitioned from architecture to the exciting world of Data! 🚀 
<p>Yes! I'm now more interested in the structure of a database than the structure of a building. </p>
My journey into the data world started with a love for problem-solving and analytical thinking and a desire to build innovative solutions.

## 🌟 About me 
#### 🔄 Career Switcher
  After several years in architecture, I decided to take a leap and dive into the exciting world of Data Analysis and Data Science. It's been an incredible journey of learning and growth, and I'm thrilled to share my projects with you. I'm particularly interested in Data Visualization and Data Science (I want to be a Data Scientist one day), and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks.
#### 🌱 New Beginning
  I'm currently learning through online course of OpenClassRooms.
#### 🤓 Lifelong Learner
  There is a saying in Chinese: "Curiosity killed the cat," which means that excessive curiosity can lead to unnecessary trouble or danger. However, in the world of data, not having curiosity is what's truly dangerous. Curiosity is essential for continual growth and discovery in the ever-evolving field of data.
#### 🤩 Language enthusiast
  English, French, Japanese, Chinese, SQL, Python, etc...

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
* Data Analysis: MySQL, Python (Pandas, Numpy)
* Data Visualization: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI 
* Graphical conception: Adobe Creative Suites
